    // If you have two objects between renders, object A and then object B, even if those have all of
    // the same properties, you're going to get a rerun of your useEffect because it does this shallow comparison,
    // because the object before is not the same as the current object, even if they look exactly the same.
    // Keep in mind that the values that you pass in here are compared basically as if you were to do a triple equals, or Object.is(), which is what react is using internally.
